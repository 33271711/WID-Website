Hi Group,

I have added a ReadMe to remind you some ground rules before committing any changes to the GitHub folder:

1. Make sure to name all the changes, no matter how small.
2. Make sure that you have noted the changes in the Changelog sheet, which is under the General Excel Online sheet.
3. Check if you have pressed Push to Origin in the app. If you haven't, most likely the changes haven't gone through.
4. Double check that you have all the changes saved, double check again of GitHub if you want to be extra safe.
5. For conventional naming of images, please use: {{image_section}}-{{image_type}}-{{image_name}}.{{extension}}

Thanks for reading this ReadMe. Cheers!
